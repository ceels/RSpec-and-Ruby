# RSpec-and-Ruby

I'm putting together a repo for a friend so she can have a go at teaching herself Ruby and RSpec. I'm using material from two repos - [alexch's learn_ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) and [ultrasaurus' test-first-teaching](https://github.com/ultrasaurus/test-first-teaching)

To get started you need to have git installed on your command line.

Check if it is there by typing
```
git --version
```
in your terminal after the $

If not, install it by typing

```
brew install git
```

no brew?

you'll also need Docker Compose

```
brew install docker-compose
```

After that, you need to clone the git repo onto your computer.

```
git clone git@github.com:colquhounking/RSpec-and-Ruby.git
```

Then go in to the directory you just made

```
cd Rspec-and-Ruby
```

and run

```
./auto/dev
```

in your command line
